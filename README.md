# Decimal-and-Hex-Coverter

This very simple program was made in python using tkinter to turn it into an exe file. I made it to aid me in my Assembler language class so I don't have to look up binary or hexadecimal numbers constantly. It converts decimal numbers to hexadecimal and binary, and it also converts hexadecimal numbers to decimal and binary. I used pyinstaller to turn it into a standalone executable file.
